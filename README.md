# retro-calculator
From auto-layout tour (https://github.com/qilytquang/auto-layout)

Still working on it (completed the UI, custom fonts, playing audo files)...

### What did I learn at this project:
* `UIStackView & autolayout`
* `Custom priorities to make more responsive`
* `Custom fonts on iOS 10`
* `Playing audio files on iOS 10`
